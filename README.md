# GUI for powershell command execution
By adding a simple commented out header to your script file, the PSGUI application
generates input fields corresponding to all of the required command-line arguments
required for your script. Different types of input fields such as text-only, digits-only
password fields and multi-line text fields are available.
The script-header also allows for a description of the script to be shown through the GUI.

# Wiki
Check the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/thomasgg42/PowershellGUI/wiki) for how the header
section of the script files must look like.
